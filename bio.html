    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>
       Neck deep in the cloud since the'cloud' became part of the parlance of our time.  Beginning as the first delivery
       consultant in EMEA for Microsoft UK with directory syncronisation and the Business Productivity Online Suite and shortly
       thereafter pre-beta involvement with 'Red Dog'; a.k.a. AZURE.

       Prior to the modern era of public cloud computing I have over 20 years of broad technology exposure with a well-defined
       arc of responsibility in disciplines such as cybersecurity, networking, operations, and infrastructure.
